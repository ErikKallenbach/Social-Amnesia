# Socal-Scrubber
Cleans out the old gunk from your social media profiles!

This is in very early versions, but the eventual goal is to create a user-friendly app that will allow one click and scheduled cleaning of social media accounts. What does "cleaning" mean? On a site like twitter, this could be removing old tweets, retweets, and likes. On a site like reddit, this could be deleting submissions and comments. This readme will contain a list of what sites are usable and what features are available on each one.

### How to run
For now, simply run `python3 main.py` in the `reddit` folder.

## Reddit
* Can delete comments and submissions.
* Can keep a time range of comments and submissions (in hours)
* Can keep comments or submissions that are above a certain amount of upvotes.
